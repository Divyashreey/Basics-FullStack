        <h3>What is FullStack ?</h3>
        <p>Full stack development refers to the development  of both front end (client side) 
            and back end (server side) portions of web applications.
            A full stack developer is a person who can develop both client and server software.
            In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, they also know how to program a browser 
            (like using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue), program a server (like using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node), and program a database 
            (like using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB).
            Full stack developers have the ability to design complete web applications and websites.
            They work on the frontend, backend, database and debugging of web applications or websites</p>

            <h3>Why we are moving to FullStack ?</h3>
            <p>Full stack developers are in high demand due to the diverse skill set they can bring to a project. 
                They can build complete web applications and work with both front-end and back-end technologies.
                 This makes them more cost-effective and faster in development. 
                 They are also more adaptable and have higher responsibility, which leads to faster bug resolution.
                  Full-stack development is not only about learning various front-end and back-end technologies. 
                  It's also about understanding the two areas in sufficient detail and making communication between them easy and smooth.
                   As technologies and industries evolve, 
                 Full-Stack developers will need to learn new technologies to stay abreast of the latest trends</p>

                <h3>Why FullStack is Important ?</h3>
                <p>Full-stack development is becoming an increasingly important skill 
                    to have in the ever-growing and constantly changing world of technology. Full-stack developers can work on a website or application from start to finish, meaning they can create the design, build the code, and launch it into production. The main benefit of full-stack development is that it saves both time and money.
                     When a developer is able to work on both the front-end and back-end of a web application,
                     they can complete the project much more quickly</p>
